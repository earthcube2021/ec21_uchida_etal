In this repository, we provide an example notebook to calculate the Eliassen-Palm (E-P) flux divergence within the quasi-geostrophic (QG) framework.
The notebooks provide an overview of how different definitions of the E-P flux are related to one another.
The E-P flux and its divergence are then diagnosed from the last time step of a 101-member, double-gyre QG ensemble simulation output.
